RUN THE .EXE OR BAT FILE TO 
START BUILDING THE SERVER 
(server's ip is 26.163.147.10 on default)

you can change the ip in the server.properties file GOOD LUCK!

FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING READ THE ENTIRE TEXT AFTER THIS: 
the files in the folder are all the files you need to start a 
server for the first time, which i tried to keep as small as 
possible.

the "minecraft_server.jar" is the java server file, which is run on spigot mc release 1.16.5. after you run the server for the first time, you can add plugins into your plugins folder, which can be downloaded from https://www.spigotmc.org.

different versions and varaints (bukkit/forge/etc) may be added soon

version 1.8.x is to be added in the next update

the "minecraftservermaker.exe" file is a compiled version that serves the exact same purpose as the "minecraftserver.bat" file

to change the server name and etc surf throughout the "server.properties" file
